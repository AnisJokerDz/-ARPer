The address resolution protocol (arp) is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC826], specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol, so this scripy that is coded by Anis Joker Dz in python allows you to capture and spoof the packets that are passed through the protocol and i used scapy because it is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies
